# Personal Information (About Me)
**Name:** Andrew Chen

**Student Number:** S3599919

**Email Address:** S3599919@student.rmit.edu.au

**Basic Background Information:** I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. 

**Hobbies/Facts About Me:** I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies also include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. 

# Interest in IT 
**● What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?Outline your IT experience (if any).**

My interest in IT began when I was quite young, I had always been fascinated with the progression of technology and how quickly it had advanced throughout the years that I had grown. I first bought a computer when I was in Grade 4-5 when social media was still booming for our current demographic, I would use it daily to browse the web and to socialise with my friends from school. It wasn't until I went to high school and had a class called "Information Technology" that had kickstarted my hobby of building computers and learning more about them. Ever since, my love for computers has sparked and I have been regularly keeping up to date with the latest news in technology and have also been building computers on the side as a hobby for friends and for people who are having trouble deciding what parts they need in order to help build a computer specifically made for what they are intending to do. 

**● Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

The reason as to why I had chosen RMIT in the first place was because it was the first University that had taken in my application during VCE, whilst it had a well known reputation and specific programs for letting students progress their knowledge in the I.T field, I had taken up the offer in hopes to boost and learn more about my current hobby. I also had a few older friends whom had studied "Business Information Systems" that said it was a great course to learn about and that there were many great career options/paths that came out of that course, hence I took upon their word and went to RMIT to study. Although there were many other options to study elsewhere at other Universities, my choice with RMIT has been a choice that I do not regret at all. 

**● What do you expect to learn during your studies?** 

Some things that I would expect to learn during my studies would be definitely how to configure hardware and how to implement coding onto a website, hands-on approach to studies is one thing that I enjoy doing the most as it lets me physically work with something that I love using, computers. Not only are these the only things that I'm looking forward to but there are some others such as the fundamentals of IT systems and introductory levels to programming, hopefully as I progress I can learn about other in depth information that would enable me to become an IT specialist. In the end, I hope to be able to figure out what hardware and software would be suited to the situation that I may be stuck in and to be able to correctly support and troubleshoot any problems that may occur.

Being an IT Technical Support Offer means being someone who is able to help client/customers in need of help in regards to their IT related enquiries whilst maintaing the highest level of profresionalism and advice giving when on the job. This position appeals to me because I have always wanted to use my knowledge gained in the IT field to put it to good use for the community and other business' that may need some assistance. Hopefully as I climb up to the top in this sector I will be able to gain much more experience and knowledge to be able to one day become a leader of my own company in IT Technical Support. 

Some skills, qualifications and experiences needed for this job include; relevant tertiary qualification and roughly 12 months experience in a similar role.  Being able to use the basic Microsoft programs, and having knowledge of networks (LAN/WAN), and having a motivation to strive for success will be required for the position. Being able to uitilise some of the key technologies such as; Windows 10, Microsoft Office 365 - All programs within that too. Citrix, Skyping for Business and Audio and Visual (conferencing) calls are all supported for this position. Most importantly having a can-do attitude and having superior oral and written abilities are a bonus. 

Skills that I currently do have would be my basic knowledge on how to utilise computers and troubleshooting them, also being able to multitask and work fast and effectively whilst doing everything by the book is also an ability that I have. I can make recommendations on upgrades and replacements if ever need be, just like how I do normally with my side job, I have basic knowledge in networking aswell, and can talk and speak more than one language. I am able to prioritise my work load and management my time wisely. 

A plan that I would undertake to be able to get to the level of experience needed to join this position would be to; learn more and expand my knowledge in all the fields mentioned in the report so that I become up to date, a program that I am not familiar with is Citrix, which is presumeably an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service, and cloud computing technologies. A way I can achieve learning about Citrix would be to undertake short courses at a TAFE to further supplement my education qualifications with current industry certifications. This will be applied for all other obtainable skills and qualifications as the I.T Industry is fast-changing technology that changes every single day at a rapid pace. I.T Certification courses are offered online aswell, therefore I can make the most out of learning and upgrading my qualifications so that I am certified and able to do my job properly without any problems or hassles.
