# Personal Information (About Me)
**Name:** Andrew Chen

**Student Number:** S3599919

**Email Address:** S3599919@student.rmit.edu.au

**Basic Background Information:** I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. 

**Hobbies/Facts About Me:** I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies also include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. 

# Interest in IT 
**● What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?Outline your IT experience (if any).**

My interest in IT began when I was quite young, I had always been fascinated with the progression of technology and how quickly it had advanced throughout the years that I had grown. I first bought a computer when I was in Grade 4-5 when social media was still booming for our current demographic, I would use it daily to browse the web and to socialise with my friends from school. It wasn't until I went to high school and had a class called "Information Technology" that had kickstarted my hobby of building computers and learning more about them. Ever since, my love for computers has sparked and I have been regularly keeping up to date with the latest news in technology and have also been building computers on the side as a hobby for friends and for people who are having trouble deciding what parts they need in order to help build a computer specifically made for what they are intending to do. 

**● Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

The reason as to why I had chosen RMIT in the first place was because it was the first University that had taken in my application during VCE, whilst it had a well known reputation and specific programs for letting students progress their knowledge in the I.T field, I had taken up the offer in hopes to boost and learn more about my current hobby. I also had a few older friends whom had studied "Business Information Systems" that said it was a great course to learn about and that there were many great career options/paths that came out of that course, hence I took upon their word and went to RMIT to study. Although there were many other options to study elsewhere at other Universities, my choice with RMIT has been a choice that I do not regret at all. 

**● What do you expect to learn during your studies?** 

Some things that I would expect to learn during my studies would be definitely how to configure hardware and how to implement coding onto a website, hands-on approach to studies is one thing that I enjoy doing the most as it lets me physically work with something that I love using, computers. Not only are these the only things that I'm looking forward to but there are some others such as the fundamentals of IT systems and introductory levels to programming, hopefully as I progress I can learn about other in depth information that would enable me to become an IT specialist. In the end, I hope to be able to figure out what hardware and software would be suited to the situation that I may be stuck in and to be able to correctly support and troubleshoot any problems that may occur.
