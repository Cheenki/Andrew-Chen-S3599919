# Interest in IT 
**● What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?Outline your IT experience (if any).**
My interest in IT began when I was quite young I had always been facinated with the progression of technology and how quickly it had advanced throughout the years that I had grown. I first bought a computer when i was in Grade 6 when social media was still booming for our current demographic, I would use it daily to browse the web and to socialise with my friends from school. It wasn't until I went to high school and had a class called "Information Technology" that had kickstarted my hobbie of building computers and learning more about them. Ever since my love for computers have sparked and I have been regularly keeping up to date with the latest in technology and building computers on the side as a hobby for friends and people who are having trouble deciding what parts they need in order to build a computer specifically made for what they are intending to do.
